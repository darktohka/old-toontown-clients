If Disney becomes aware that a Parent Account is under the age of 18, Disney reserves the right to cancel the Account.\n\nAny fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity may be grounds for termination of your Account, at Disney's sole discretion, and you may be reported to appropriate law-enforcement agencies.\n",
    "\nPRICE AND PAYMENT\n\nDisney reserves the right at any time to charge additional fees for access to the Service. Disney reserves the right to change the amount of, or basis for determining, any fees or charges for the Service, and to institute new fees or charges effective upon prior notice to Members.  Disney reserves the right to provide the Service at no charge for promotional reasons or otherwise (such as a free trial).\n\nEach Parent Account agrees to pay all charges to the Parent's Account, including applicable taxes, in accordance with billing terms in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable. Parent Accounts must provide Disney with valid credit card information as requested during the registration process.\n",
    "\nDisney shall charge the Parent Account's credit card on the date Parent Account subscribes to the Service. Thereafter, Disney will automatically renew and charge the Parent's Account as follows:\n\n-Each month for the following month's service for monthly subscriptions\n\n-Upon every three(3)-month anniversary of the first billing date for quarterly subscriptions\n\n-Upon every six(6)-month anniversary of the first billing date for semiannual subscriptions\n\n-Upon every one(1)-year anniversary of the first billing date for annual subscriptions\n",
    '\nThe renewal charge shall be equal to or less than the original subscription price, unless otherwise notified in advance by Disney. You may notify Disney that you wish to cancel your subscription at any time.  Disney agrees that it will terminate your Account upon receipt of notification from the Parent Account, as described below.\n\nFor monthly subscriptions: If notice of cancellation is received within the first 15 days following the first day of the initial billing, you will be eligible to receive a refund of all subscription fees for the Service, but will still be obligated to pay any other charges incurred. If you cancel the Service more than 15 days after the initial billing, your Account will be canceled as of the end of the current billing period and no refund for unused time will be given.\n',
    '\nFor quarterly subscriptions: If notice of cancellation is received within the first 30 days following the first day of the initial billing, you will be eligible to receive a refund of all subscription fees for the Service, but will still be obligated to pay any other charges incurred.

If you cancel the Service more than 30 days after the initial billing, no refund for unused time will be given.\n\nYour right to use the Service is subject to any limits established by Disney or by your credit card issuer. If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your charge is returned to Disney for any reason, including chargeback, Disney reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access and Account, thereby terminating this Agreement and all obligations of Disney hereunder.\n',
    '\nIf you have a balance due on any Disney Account, you agree that Disney can charge these unpaid fees to your credit card. Disney reserves the right to establish a credit limit (the "Ceiling") for each Member. If a Member\'s Account reaches the Ceiling at any time, Disney may immediately bill the Member\'s credit card for all unpaid charges on account. Until further notice, the Ceiling for each Member is $100.\n\nIf you have reason to believe that your Account is no longer secure (for example, in the event of a loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure or use of your Member Name, Password, or any credit, debit, or charge card number stored on the Service), you must promptly change your Password and notify Disney of the problem (by notice given as described in the Notice section below) to avoid possible liability for any unauthorized charges to your Account.\n',
    '\nPARENTAL CONSENT\n\nUnder the Children\'s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), parental consent is required for the online collection, use and/or disclosure of personal information obtained from a child under the age of 13.  As part of the registration process for the Service, the Parent Account will be asked to provide a valid credit card.  Parents and legal guardians, you will be allowed to create up to six Toons (a Toon is a character you create and use to play the game in the Service), all will be under the Parent Account.  Kids will need to have a parent or legal guardian register as the Parent Account holder and then they can create their own Toon within the Parent Account.\n',
    '\nBy providing his or her credit card number, the Parent Account holder: (a) represents and warrants that he or she is the parent or legal guardian of any child under the age of 13 for whom he or she allows to use the Parent Account; and (b) agrees to our collection, use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the Privacy Policy with respect to any child under the age of 13 for whom the Parent Account holder allows to use the Parent Account.\n\nThe Service includes an interactive feature we call Secret Friends.  The Parent Account will be given the opportunity to disable the Secret Friends feature once he or she is inside the Service. Secret Friends allows one member to chat with another member only by means of a secret code that must be communicated outside of the game.  Secret Friends is not moderated or supervised.\n',
    '\nIf the Parent Account allows a child to use his or her account with the Secret Friends feature enabled, we encourage parents to supervise their child or children while they play in the Service.  By enabling the Secret Friends feature, the Parent Account acknowledges that there are some risks inherent in the Secret Friends feature and that the Parent Account has been informed of, and agrees to accept, any such risks.  You will be given the opportunity to learn more about the Secret Friends feature, and the chance to enable it, once you are inside the Service.\n',
    '\nNOTICE\n\nThe Parent Account will submit and maintain a correct e-mail address and other Account information. We may give notice to the Parent Account by means of a general notice on the Service, electronic mail to your e-mail address on record in our Account information, or by written communication sent by first-class mail to your address on record in our Account information. You may give notice to Disney. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Disney at any time by e-mail at toontown@disneyonline.com.\n',

    "\nPrivacy Policy\n\nQ1 What types of information are WDIG sites collecting, and how are the sites collecting it?\n\nThe majority of great products and services on our sites are offered without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You can surf WDIG's Web sites and view much of our terrific content anonymously. For instance, you can view news headlines at ABCNEWS.com without giving out any personally identifiable information.\n\nInformation You Provide\nThere are a few activities on our sites where the collection of personally identifiable information is necessary. Those activities include things like entering a contest or sweepstakes, making a purchase, or contacting us. When personally identifiable information is collected, you will know because you will have to fill out a form. For most activities, we collect only your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, and zip code. When you make a purchase, we also collect your street and billing addresses, your phone number, and credit card information. Depending on what you purchase, we may also need to collect other personal information, like your clothing size.\n",
    "\nInformation Collected from You with Technology\nWDIG sites collect some information about you using technology, so it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance, when you come to our site your IP address is collected so that we know where to send information you are requesting. An IP address is often associated with the place from which you enter the Internet like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. This information is not personally identifiable. WDIG sites use information collected through technology to make our sites more interesting and useful to you. This includes helping advertisers on our site design advertisements our Guests might like. We normally don't combine this type of information with personally identifiable information. However, we will combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a visitor in order to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, Guests, or others.\n\nWhat Are Cookies, and How Does WDIG Use Them?\nCookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. These pieces of information allow the Web site to remember important information that will make your use of that site more useful. WDIG and other Internet companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For instance, DisneyStore.com uses cookies to remember and process the items in your shopping cart, and all WDIG sites use cookies to make sure kids don't enter unmoderated chat rooms.\n\nYou can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many WDIG features that make your Web experience more efficient -- like the features mentioned above -- and some of our services will not function properly.\n",
    "\nQ2 How does WDIG use the personally identifiable information that has been collected?\n\nWDIG uses personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to complete transactions. For instance, if you purchase a fantasy team on ESPN.com, we use your information to process your order, or if you contact us for help we will use the information to contact you. We use information collected to notify you if you've won a game or contest. Information we collect is used to send you e-mail updates and newsletters about our sites. We also use the information you provide to send you WDIG e-mail promotions and special offers from our third-party sponsors.\n",
    '\nQ3 Does WDIG share information with companies or other organizations that are not part of the WDIG family of sites?\n\nOne of the most valuable assets of our business is you. We aren\'t in the business of selling information about our Guests. However, if there is a value for our Guests, we will share your information or send you messages on behalf of another company as described below. We will also share information for security reasons.\nCompanies That Are "Standing in the Shoes" of WDIG\nSometimes we hire companies to help us deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package. In those instances, we need to share your information with them. These companies are basically "standing in the shoes" of WDIG, and they are allowed to use the information only to deliver the product or service.\n',
    "\nCompanies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services\nOn occasion, we offer promotions -- like sweepstakes or free subscriptions -- in conjunction with a sponsor. We will share your information with the sponsors if they need it to send you a product, such as a magazine subscription. We may share your information with those sponsors so that they can send you other special promotions they offer, but only if you give us your permission to do so, and we will share it only with that specific sponsor. In addition, WDIG occasionally sends e-mail promotions out to our Guests on behalf of third-party sponsors. In this instance, we don't share your name with the third party -- we do the mailing for them. Again, we only send these promotions to you if you've given your permission.\n\nContent Partners\nOn some of our sites, we provide content that is created by a third-party partner Web site. For instance, ESPN.com provides shopping opportunities with third parties. In some instances the third-party sites will collect information in order to facilitate the transaction or to make the use of their content more productive and efficient. In these circumstances the information collected is shared between WDIG and our third-party sponsors.\n\nThird-Party Advertisers and Network Advertisers\nTo help increase privacy protections for our Guests, WDIG allows advertising on our sites from only those companies that have their own privacy policy. Once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left WDIG sites, our privacy policy no longer applies. You must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their site.\n",
    '\nIn addition, many business advertisements are managed and placed on our site by third-party companies. These companies are called "network advertisers." Network advertisers collect non-personally identifiable information when you click on or scan one of their banner advertisements. The information is collected using technology, so you may not realize it\'s being collected. The network advertisers collect this information so that they can show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you. If you would like to read more about network advertisers or do not want network advertisers to collect this non-personally identifiable information about you, click here.\n\nPurchase or Sale of Businesses\nOnline business is still in a very early stage and is changing and evolving rapidly. As WDIG continually looks for ways to improve our business, we may buy or sell a company. If we buy or sell a business, the names collected will likely be transferred as a part of the sale. Information about registrants will be used in the aggregate. However, if we buy a business, we will honor the requests that customers made of that business regarding e-mail communications. In the event that we sell a business, we will do everything in our power to ensure that the e-mail communications requests you made of us are honored.\n\nOrganizations That Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Guests and Our Sites\nWe will give out personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our Terms of Service, or site or game rules; or to protect the safety and security of Guests and our sites.\n',
    "\nQ4 What choices do I have about WDIG collecting, using, and sharing my information?\n\nIt is possible for you to use much of our site without giving us any personally identifiable information. When you do register with us or give us personally identifiable information, you will have an opportunity at the time we collect your information -- to limit e-mail communications from WDIG and from our third-party partners. You can request at any time that WDIG not send future e-mail to you either by unsubscribing from the communication or by contacting us at memberservices@help.go.com. Also, as mentioned above, there are ways to limit the information collected through technology -- though some of our features won't work if you decide to do this.\n",
    "\nQ5 What type of security does WDIG provide?\n\nThe importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our Guests is of utmost concern to us. WDIG takes technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect all visitors' information. When you provide credit card information, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect it. There are some things that you can do to help protect the security of your information as well. For instance, never give out your Password, since this is what is used to access all of your account information. Also remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish surfing the Web, so that other people using the same computer won't have access to your information.\n",
    '\nQ6 How can I access my account information?\n\nYou can access the personally identifiable information you gave us during registration at our Account Options center available from (http://play.toontown.com).  Log-in with your account name and parent password. There are instructions on the start page to help you recover your password if you\'ve forgotten it.\nYou can also contact us by clicking "Contact Us" in the footer on any WDIG page and selecting "Registration/Personalization" in the drop down box, or send an e-mail directly to memberservices@help.go.com. Please include information in the e-mail that will help us identify your account so we can assist you with your inquiry or request.\n',
    '\nQ7 Whom do I contact with questions or concerns about this privacy policy?\n\nIf you need further assistance, please send an e-mail with your questions or comments to memberservices@help.go.com\nwrite us at:\n\nMember Services\nWalt Disney Internet Group\n506 2nd Avenue\nSuite 2100\nSeattle, WA 98104\n\nWalt Disney Internet Group is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. If you believe that WDIG has not responded to your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact TRUSTe http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html.\n*You must be 18 or have the permission of your parent or guardian to dial this number.\n',
    "\nKids' Privacy Policy:\nWe recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections for kids who visit our sites.\n\nQ1 What types of information are WDIG sites collecting about kids who are 12 and younger?\n\nChildren can surf Disney.com or other WDIG sites, view content, and play some games without any personally identifiable information being collected. In addition, we occasionally do host some moderated chat rooms where no personally identifiable information is collected or posted. However, in some areas it is necessary to collect personally identifiable information from kids to allow participation in an activity (like entering a contest) or to communicate with our community (via e-mail or message boards).\nWDIG believes it is good policy not to collect more personally identifiable information from kids 12 and younger than is necessary for them to participate in our online activities. In addition, be aware that all sites that are targeted to children 12 and younger are prohibited by law from collecting more information than they need.\n\nThe only personally identifiable information we collect from kids is first name, parent's e-mail address, and child's birth date. We collect birth date to validate a Guest's age. We may also collect personal information, like a pet's name, to help Guests remember their Log-in Name and Password if they forget them.\n\nWe also allow parents to request at any time that the information collected about their child be removed from our database. If you would like to deactivate your child's account, please send an e-mail message to ms_support@help.go.com with your child's Log-in Name and Password requesting that the account be cancelled.\n",
    "\nQ2 How does WDIG use and share the personally identifiable information that has been collected?\n\nNo information collected from Guests 12 and younger is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside Walt Disney Internet Group's family of sites.\nThe information collected about kids 12 and younger is used only by WDIG Web sites to provide services (such as calendars) or to conduct some games or contests. Although Guests 12 and younger may be allowed to participate in some contests where information is collected, notification and prizes are sent to the parents' or guardians' e-mail address provided during the initial registration process. Publication of contest winners' full names, ages, or images for individuals 12 and younger require parental or guardian consent. Sometimes a nonidentifiable version of a child's name will be published. In those circumstances, parents may not be contacted again for permission.\n\nWe do not allow kids 12 and younger to participate in unmoderated chat rooms.\n\nWe will give out personal information about kids if required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our Terms of Service, or site or game rules; or to protect the safety and security of Guests and our sites.\n",
    "\nQ3 Does WDIG notify parents about the collection of information on kids 12 and younger?\n\nAny time children 12 and younger register with us, we send an e-mail notification to their parent or guardian. In addition, we require parents to give express permission before we will allow their children to use e-mail, message boards, and other features where personally identifiable information can be made public to the Internet and shared with users of all ages.\nWe also give parents 48 hours to refuse any registrations kids make in order to play games and contests. If we don't hear back, we assume it's ok for a child to be registered with us. Once a child has registered, he or she will be allowed to enter any future registration-based games and contests, and parents aren't notified again. In this instance, we use the information collected only to notify parents when a child has won a game or contest. We don't use this information for any other purpose.\n",
    "\nQ4 How do parents access information about their kids?\n\nHere are three methods to review the information that has been collected about children who are 12 and younger.\n\nWhen parents give their children access to interactive features like message boards, they are required to establish a family account. Once a family account is established, the primary account holder can review the personally identifiable information of all family member accounts including a child's. You can access this information by logging in to your family account at the Your Account home page.\n\nIf you are not already a member of any of the WDIG sites, you can review your child's personally identifiable information by logging in to your child's account at the Account Options Home Page. You will need to have your child's account name and password. There are instructions on the Your Account home page to help you recover your child's password if they've forgotten it.\n\nYou can also contact Customer Service to view the information that has been collected from or about your child by sending an e-mail to ms_support@help.go.com. If you have not yet established a family account, you will need to have your child's user name and password. Please include information (child's account name, parent email address) in the email that will help us identify your child's account so we can assist you with your inquiry or request.\n",
    "\nQ5 What type of security does WDIG provide?\n\nThe importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. WDIG takes technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect all visitors' information. When you provide credit card information, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect it. There are some things that you can do to help protect the security of your information as well. For instance, never give out your Password, since this is what is used to access all of your account information. Also remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish surfing the Web so that other people using the same computer won't have access to your information.\n",
    '\nQ6 How will WDIG notify parents if this privacy policy changes?\n\nIf WDIG changes this privacy policy, we will notify parents via e-mail.\n\nQ7 Whom do I contact with questions or concerns about this privacy policy?\n\nIf you need further assistance, please send an e-mail with your questions or comments to ms_support@help.go.com\nwrite us at:\n\nMember Services\nWalt Disney Internet Group\n506 2nd Avenue\nSuite 2100\nSeattle, WA 98104\nor call us at (509) 742-4698\n\nWalt Disney Internet Group is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.

    '\nThe Secret Friends Feature\n\nThe Secret Friends feature enables a member to chat directly with another member within Disney\'s Toontown Online (the "Service") once the members establish a Secret Friends connection.  When your child attempts to use the Secret Friends feature, we will require that you indicate your consent to your child\'s use of this feature by entering your Parent Password.  Here is a detailed description of the process of creating a Secret Friends connection between members whom we will call "Sally" and "Mike."\n1. Sally\'s parent and Mike\'s parent each enable the Secret Friends feature by entering their respective Parent Passwords either (a) in the Account Options areas within the Service, or (b) when prompted within the game by a Parental Controls pop-up.\n2. Sally requests a Secret (described below) from within the Service.\n',
    "\n3. Sally's Secret is communicated to Mike outside of the Service. (Sally's Secret may be communicated to Mike either directly by Sally, or indirectly through Sally's disclosure of the Secret to another person.)\n4. Mike submits Sally's Secret to the Service within 48 hours of the time that Sally requested the Secret from the Service.\n5. The Service then notifies Mike that Sally has become Mike's Secret Friend.  The Service similarly notifies Sally that Mike has become Sally's Secret Friend.\n6. Sally and Mike can now chat directly with each other until either one chooses to terminate the other as a Secret Friend, or until the Secret Friends feature is disabled for either Sally or Mike by their respective parent.  The Secret Friends connection can thus be disabled anytime by either: (a) a member removing the Secret Friend from his or her friends list (as described in the Service); or, (b) the parent of that member disabling the Secret Friends feature by going to the Account Options area within the Service and following the steps set forth there.\n",
    "\nA Secret is a computer-generated random code assigned to a particular member. The Secret must be used to activate a Secret Friend connection within 48 hours of the time that the member requests the Secret; otherwise, the Secret expires and cannot be used.  Moreover, a single Secret can only be used to establish one Secret Friend connection.  To make additional Secret Friend connections, a member must request an additional Secret for each additional Secret Friend.\n\nSecret Friendships do not transfer.  For example, if Sally becomes a Secret Friend of Mike, and Mike becomes a Secret Friend of Jessica, Sally does not automatically become Jessica's Secret Friend.  In order for Sally and Jessica to become Secret Friends, one of them must request a new Secret from the Service and communicate it to the other.\n",
    '\nSecret Friends communicate with one another in a free-form interactive chat.  The content of this chat is directly entered by the participating member and is processed through the Service, which is operated by the Walt Disney Internet Group ("WDIG"), 506 2nd Avenue, Suite 2100, Seattle, WA 98104 (telephone (509) 742-4698; email ms_support@help.go.com).  While we advise members not to exchange personal information such as first and last names, e-mail addresses, postal addresses, or phone numbers while using Secret Friends, we cannot guarantee that such exchanges of personal information will not happen. Although the Secret Friends chat is automatically filtered for most bad words, it is not moderated or supervised by us.  If parents allow their children to use their account with the Secret Friends feature enabled, we encourage parents to supervise their children while they play in the Service.\n',
    "\nWDIG does not use the content of Secret Friends chat for any purpose other than communicating that content to the member's secret friend, and does not disclose that content to any third party except: (1) if required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; (2) to enforce the Terms of Use applicable to the Service (which may be accessed on the home page of the Service); or, (3) to protect the safety and security of Members of the Service and the Service itself.  Upon request to WDIG, a child's parent can review and have deleted any Secret Friends chat content supplied by that child, provided that such chat content has not already been deleted by WDIG from its files.  In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we are prohibited from conditioning, and do not condition, a child's participation in any activity (including Secret Friends) on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.\n",
    '\nIn addition, as noted above, we recognize the right of a parent to refuse to permit us to continue to allow a child to use the Secret Friends feature. By enabling the Secret Friends feature, you acknowledge that there are some risks inherent in the ability of members to chat with one another through the Secret Friends feature, and that you have been informed of, and agree to accept, any such risks.\n']
